Things that should be fixed, whenever. It’s been 4 years, a few months wont set it back.

* Add support for the newer skins (1.8 isn’t that new…)
* Add support for slim arms (aka base model Alex)
* Add support for pulling down a user skin with the new crappy API
* (and then check if it still has the same CORS problems as in 2011)
* Constantly poke Mojang to add POST support so we can submit
* Add idle animation because why not
* Fix README to suck less
